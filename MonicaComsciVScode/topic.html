            <p>Vaquita is known for being an elusive marine mammal, which help them escape potential predators such as sharks and orcas. They can be identified as being shy, timid, and evades boats and human activity. Their small size, quiet surface rolls, and rapid movements make them difficult to observe. Being hard to observe makes them challenging to study and data collection is limited. Like other cetaceans, vaquitas rely on echolocation to navigate, communicate, and locate prey. They emit a series of high-frequency clicks that bounce off objects in their surroundings, allowing them to build a detailed understanding of their environment.</p>

            <p>Despite to their well-adapted nature the population of Vaquita's are is rapidly decreasing. This is due to bycatching. The Gulf of California has a thriving fishing that targets a variety of fish and shrimps particularly the Totoaba fish. Unfortunately, the illegal use of gillnets to catch the Totoaba also catches the Vaquita's. When Vaquita's are caught in the gillnets they are unable to swim to the surface for air causing them to suffocate underwater and drown. Vaquita's are a intergal part of the marine ecosystem of the Gulf of California, if they went extinct there will consequences. Conservation efforts are being made to protect the remaining Vaquita's in the wild from illegal fishing </p>
