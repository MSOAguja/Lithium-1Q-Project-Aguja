            <p>Have you ever heard a living creature called Vaquita? Do you know where it lives? They are commonly called porpoises which are closely related to dolphins and whales. They are aquatic mammals belonging to the same infraorder Cetacea. They are generally characterized in their fully aquatic lifestyle, streamlined body shape, often large size and exclusively carnivorous diet. One of the striking members of this animal is the vaquita. The etymology of vaquita comes from Spanish which translates to “little cow”. They belong to the genus Phocoena which is the Latin word “porpoise” or “pig fish.” The species Sinus means “cavity,” a reference to the Gulf of California where they inhabit hence the term Phocoena sinus meaning the “porpoise of the Gulf of California.” The name vaquita was popularized from local fishermen's name for the species.</p>
